Red/green program for measuring end-to-end latency experiment

Needs openvr in the current folder to work. It can be found at https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/API-Documentation

We ran this program with a Meta Quest 2 VR headset connected to our PC (with cable, Air Link and Virtual Desktop) in order to measure the end-to-end latency in the VR setup used in our master thesis user studies. The program was mainly written by VR project student HÃ¥kon Medhus, with invaluable help from fellow master student Theo Halvorsen.
